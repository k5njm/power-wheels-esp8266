## Parts:
- NodeMCU Amica ESP8266: https://www.amazon.com/KeeYees-Internet-Development-Wireless-Compatible/dp/B07S5Z3VYZ
- Cytron MDD10A 10Amp 5V-30V DC Motor Driver: https://www.cytron.io/p-10amp-5v-30v-dc-motor-driver-2-channels
- Power Wheels Talking Jeep (Older model)
- 24v -> 5v (or 3.3v) power supply to power NodeMCU: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M03288J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
  - 3.3v to 20v may be supplied to `vin` pin, or regulated 3.3v may be supplied to `3.3v` pin.

## Details:
Pedal Switch and 'Gear Selector' toggle switches wired to GPIOs, with the Cytron motor controller driving the motors from PWM signals generated by the NodeMCU.

Code emulates the gear selector to allow for forward fast, forward slow, and reverse slow modes. Ramping is utilized to ease power on and off when 

## To Do:
- Web interface with:
  - Settings adjustment
  - E-Stop
  - Remote driving
- Steering control (Linear actuator / steering wheel connected to potentiometer and drive by wire / power steering)
- RC Receiver inputs (two channels of RC PWM)
